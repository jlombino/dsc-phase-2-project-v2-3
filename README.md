<h1>King County Housing Price Project</h1>

Author: Jason Lombino

<h2>Business Problem</h2>
The mortgage department at Bentley & Co. Bank of Seattle is looking for an additional method of appraising the value of homes. They currently hire an appraisal management company, and will continue to do so. However, as independant appraisals can be costly and take time, Bentley & Co. Bank is looking for a tool that can estimate the value of a house cheaply and quickly.

 This will be useful for obtaining a ballpark estimate of the value of a home before an appraisal can be performed. In addition, it will be useful for estimating the price impact of any renovations performed on a house Bentley & Co. Bank has written a mortgage on without any additional appraisals.

This tool must meet two criteria to be of use to Bentley & Co. Bank:
<ol>
<li>The tool must be capable of accurately predicting the price of a house provided information about the house.</li>
<li>The tool must provide insight into what factors impact the price of a house the most.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals</h2>

Bentley Bank & Co. can use the models created in this notebook to generate a range of prices a given house can be expected to fall into.
